# Customization

To make the app recognize any face you want, follow these simple steps:

1. Collect a few photos of the person you want the app to recognize (around 4-5 photos).

2. In the `database` folder(you can clear any previous folders present), create a new folder with the same name as the person.

3. Inside the newly created folder, add the person's photos. Make sure to name each photo after the person and add an index starting from 1 at the end of the name.

4. Preferably, use photos in the `jpg` format.

**For example:**
- `database`
  - `person1`
    - `person1_1.jpg`
    - `person1_2.jpg`
    - `person1_3.jpg`

This way, the app will be trained to recognize the specified person based on the provided photos.
