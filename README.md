# Face-Recognition 

This is a Streamlit web application for face recognition using a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model and the DeepFace library. The app allows users to upload an image, detects faces, and performs face recognition to identify known faces.



## Quick Overview of Working

- **Face Detection**: The app uses the YOLO model to detect faces in uploaded images.
 
- **Face Extraction**: Crop and save the detected faces.

- **Face Recognition**: The DeepFace library is employed for face recognition. Known faces are saved in the 'known' folder, and unknown faces are saved in the 'unknown' folder.

- **User-friendly Interface**: The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NikhilKalloli/Face-Recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```
    cd Face-Recognition
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies(in a virtual Environment):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
    ``` 
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```

## Customization
 Currently the model is trained on the following World leaders:
 - [Narendra Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi)
 - [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden)
 - [Ajay Banga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Banga)
 - [Lula da Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva)
 - [Cyril Ramaphosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa)   
      
To be able to recognise any face you want to all you need is a few photos of that person and follow the documentation [here](https://github.com/NikhilKalloli/Face-Recognition/blob/main/Custom.md).

Watch a Youtube Video [here](https://youtu.be/FoQ_aJkYwBE?si=wyG9eSOnqBg0upyL) if you find it hard to follow.


## Deployment
I would advise to deploy it on [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/) since the libraries are larger in size and other deployment services will run out of memory while building the application. Make sure you include `packages.txt` consisting of  `libgl1-mesa-glx` library.
